    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jared</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>
      Best director Christopher Nolan using one of the great actors of his time,
      Christian Bale.
    </p>

    <h3>Fight Club</h3>
    <p>
      Very stylish and mind bending entertainment. Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are
      fantastic in film.
    </p>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>
      Another mind bending film from Christopher Nolan and great performance
      from Matthew McConaughey.
